   <h2>Basic Info:</h2>
    <p>Set in medieval times Dark souls 3 is a game where you slay evil monsters with the power of magic,swords and glowing fireballs.</p>
    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>The game is hard. Really hard. The first boss in the game is a guy named Iudex Gundyr. For the first boss in the game he is hard. Really hard. At half health he turns into a giant raven-sort of thing that jumps into the air and slams into you which takes down half of your health IN ONE HIT. So that's hard. Then the game flings Nameless kings and Souls of cinder at you causing mental breakdowns. So yeah. The games hard. But fun.</p>
    <h2>Rating:</h2>
<p>four and three quater stars.(just because its hard dose'nt mean its not good.)</p>
    <h3>Thats all folks!</h3>
