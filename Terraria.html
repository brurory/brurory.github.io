<h2>Basic Info:</h2>
<p>The game is available on pc, 3ds, ps4 and Xbox. It is A game full of adventure, bosses and building , building and more building! It is described as "<em>3d Minecraft".</em> I find this is wrong as the game is better than Minecraft and there is way more ways to play and explore.<p>
    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>If you like exploring games and do not mind if they are in 2d than this is perfect for you! The bosses in the game are hard and a great challenge for even experienced gamers like me. So I would reccomend this game for people who like minecraft or games where you have to survive</p>
